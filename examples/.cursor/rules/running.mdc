## Running dev mode

Start the development server from the `examples/concurrent` directory:

```bash
cd examples/concurrent && yarn start
```

Or from the repo root:

```bash
yarn workspace concurrent run start
```

## Dependencies on Packages

This example depends on packages in `packages/*`. If you modify a package, rebuild it first before testing here.

When doing this, don't use the cache via `WEBPACK_CACHE=none` env
