[Anansi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anansi) (/…ôÀàn…ëÀênsi/ …ô-NAHN-see) is an Akan folktale character. He often takes the shape of a spider and is considered to be the god of all knowledge of stories. Anansi uses his knowledge to help JavaScript developers spin new web projects.

## Motivation

Starting a new React project can be a lot of work. There are many tools that need to work together. The best tools available keep a tight technical focus with high levels of configurability. In practice this means it's a lot of work to get started and even more work to maintain, while keeping the tools cleanly working together.

Like Ubuntu did for Linux; Anansi focuses on bringing together many powerful tools in unison to build high performance web applications, quickly - while not losing the power and flexibility each individual tool provides.

- Start a project in a minute
- Modular and Incremental
- Modern
  - Stay up with the latest best in class tooling by a simple package upgrade
- Batteries included
- DRY configurations
- Battle-tested

## Installation

<details><summary><b><a href="https://nodejs.org/">node.js</a> >=10 and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm</a> >=6 are required.</b></summary>

Use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install these if you don't already.

```bash
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.38.0/install.sh | bash
```
</details>

Next install Anansi's CLI

```bash
npm install -g @anansi/cli yarn
```

Then generate your new project:

```bash
anansi hatch my-app-name
```

This creates a `my-app-name` directory in your current directory and sets up the project there.

## Updates

Features can be incrementally adopted by running sub-generators from an existing project directory.

### E.g., Adding Testing

```shell
cd my-app-name
anansi add testing
```

## Running SSR

```bash
Usage: anansi serve [options] <entrypath>

runs server for SSR projects

Arguments:
  entrypath             Path to entrypoint

Options:
  -p, --pubPath <path>  Where to serve assets from
  -d, --dev             Run devserver rather than using previously compiled output
  -h, --help            display help for command
```

```json
{
  "start": "anansi serve --dev ./src/index.tsx",
  "start:prod": "anansi serve --pubPath=/assets/ ./dist-server/App.js",
}
```
