## Package Manager
- Use `yarn` for all package management tasks (install, add, remove, etc.)
- This is a Yarn workspaces monorepo

## Project Structure
- Monorepo with packages in `packages/*` and examples in `examples/*`
- Use workspace protocols (`workspace:*`) for internal dependencies

## Code Style
- TypeScript is used throughout
- Follow existing ESLint configuration
- Use Prettier for formatting

## Build Artifacts
- For packages that compile source from `src/` to `lib/` or `dist/`, make edits in the corresponding `src/` files only.
- When investigating usages in `lib/` or `dist/`, replicate changes in the matching `src/` location, then rebuild to regenerate `lib/` or `dist/`.
- `packages/generator-js` compiles to `generators/` rather than `lib/` or `dist/`
